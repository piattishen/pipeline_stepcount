# pipeline_stepcount

This pipeline needs Python 3.10 and Anaconda 25.1.1 (My version).

In the directory of pipeline_oxford_stepcount, input "cmd" to replace the original address. Input: python pipeline_oxford_stepcount.py <address_text_file> <output_directory>

address_text_file should be one address per line, with or without ""
output_directory should be the file folder location

Before running this pipeline, make sure you have already init Anaconda in your environment

The result of the Oxford stepcount algorithm will be saved in a file folder called "outputs" in the output_directory
